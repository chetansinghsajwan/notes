1. **`name`** **(required) :** **`string`**
    
    Unique name to identify this preset among other configure presets.
    
2. **`displayName`** **:** **`string`**
    
    A human-friendly name of the preset.
    
3. **`description`** **:** **`string`**
    
    A human-friendly description of the preset.
    
4. **`hidden`** **:** **`bool`**
    
    A boolean specifying whether or not this preset should be hidden.
    
    - If the preset is hidden, it cannot be used in the [[CMake Options]] argument.
    - `hidden` presets are intended to be used as a base for other presets to inherit via the `inherits` field.
    
5. **`inherits`** **:** **`string | [string]`**
    
    Name of preset or names of presets to inherit from.
    
    - The preset will inherit all of the fields from the `inherits` presets by default (except `name`, `hidden`, `inherits`,`description`, and `displayName`), and can override them as desired.
    - If multiple `inherits` presets provide conflicting values for the same field, the earlier preset in the `inherits` array will be preferred.
    - A preset can only inherit from another preset that is defined in the same file or in one of the files it includes (directly or indirectly).
    - Presets in `CMakePresets.json` may not inherit from presets in `CMakeUserPresets.json`.
    
6. **`condition`** **:** `**Condition**`
    
    A [[programming/tools/cmake/presets/condition]] object to determine if the preset should be enabled.
    
    - This is allowed in preset files specifying version `3` or above.
    
7. **`vendor`** **:** **`VendorMap`**
    
    A map containing vendor-specific information.
    
    - CMake does not interpret the contents of this field except to verify that it is a map if it does exist.
    - More on [[vendor-maps]].
    
8. **`generator`** **(required | optional) :** `**string**`
    
    Generator to use for the preset.
    
    - It is required in version `2` or below. If `generator` is not specified, it must be inherited from the`inherits` preset (unless this preset is `hidden`).
    - In version `3`or above, this field may be omitted to fall back to regular generator discovery procedure.
9. **`architecture`****,** **`toolset`**
    
    Optional fields representing the platform and toolset, respectively, for [`**generators**`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-generators.7.html#manual:cmake-generators(7)) that support them.  
    See [`**cmake -A**`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake.1.html#cmdoption-cmake-A) option for possible values for `architecture` and [`**cmake -T**`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake.1.html#cmdoption-cmake-T) for `toolset`.  
    Each may be either a string or an object with the following fields:`value`An optional string representing the value.`strategy`An optional string telling CMake how to handle the `architecture` or `toolset` field. Valid values are:`"set"`Set the respective value. This will result in an error for generators that do not support the respective field.`"external"`Do not set the value, even if the generator supports it. This is useful if, for example, a preset uses the Ninja generator, and an IDE knows how to set up the Visual C++ environment from the `architecture` and `toolset` fields. In that case, CMake will ignore the field, but the IDE can use them to set up the environment before invoking CMake.  
    If no `strategy` field is given, or if the field uses the string form rather than the object form, the behavior is the same as `"set"`.
    
10. **`toolchainFile`** **:** **`string`**
    
    Path to the toolchain file.
    
    - If a relative path is specified, it is calculated relative to the build directory, and if not found,  
        relative to the source directory.
    - This field takes precedence over any [[CMake Variables]] value.
    - This field supports [[macro-expansion]].
    - It is allowed in preset files specifying version `3` or above.
11. **`binaryDir`** **(required | optional) :** **`string`**
    
    Path to the output binary directory.
    
    - If a relative path is specified, it is calculated relative to the source directory.
    - It is required in version `2` or below. If `binaryDir` is not specified, it must be inherited from the `inherits` preset (unless this preset is `hidden`).
    - This field supports [[macro-expansion]].
    - In version `3` or above, this field may be omitted.
12. **`cmakeExecutable`** **:** **`string`**
    
    Path to the CMake executable to use for this preset.
    
    - This is reserved for use by IDEs, and is not used by CMake itself.
    - IDEs that use this field should expand any macros in it.
13. **`cacheVariables`** **:** `**[string: (null | bool | object)]**`
    
    A map of cache variables.
    
    - The key is the variable name.
    - The value is either:
        - `null`
        - `bool`, can also be written as `"TRUE"` or `"FALSE"`.
        - `string` representing the value of the variable. This supports [[macro-expansion]].
        - An object with the following fields:
            - **`type`****:** **`string`**
                
                A string representing the type of the variable.
                
            - `value` **(required)**
                
                Same rules as above.
                
    - Cache variables are inherited through the `inherits` field.
    - The preset's variables will be the union of its own `cacheVariables` and the `cacheVariables` from all its parents.
    - If multiple presets in this union define the same variable, the standard rules of `inherits` are applied.
    - Setting a variable to `null` causes it to not be set, even if a value was inherited from another preset.
14. **`environment`** **:** **`[string: string]`**
    
    A map of environment variables.
    
    - The key is the variable name, and the value is either `null` or a string representing the value of the variable.
    - Environment variables in this map may reference each other, and may be listed in any order, as long as such references do not cause a cycle (for example, if `ENV_1` is `$env{ENV_2}`, `ENV_2` may not be `$env{ENV_1}`.)
    - This field supports [[macro-expansion]].
    - Environment variables are inherited through the `inherits` field, and the preset's environment will be the union of its own `environment` and the `environment` from all its parents. If multiple presets in this union define the same variable, the standard rules of `inherits` are applied.
    - Setting a variable to `null` causes it to not be set, even if a value was inherited from another preset.
    
15. **`warnings`****:** **`{}`**
    
    An object specifying the warnings to enable.
    
    The object contains the following fields:
