# Creatine Supplement

The most common creatine supplement is creatine monohydrate. It’s a dietary supplement that increases muscle performance in short-duration, high-intensity resistance exercises, such as weightlifting, sprinting and bicycling. Other forms of creatine don’t appear to have these benefits.

**How should you take it?**

**Should you take it before or after a workout?**

There's no clear answer yet, but most experts agree it's reasonable to assume that it's best to take creatine close to the time of your workout, whether that's before or after.

The most important consideration to the timing of creatine supplementation is likely consistency of intake, since this can help ensure your muscles stay well saturated.

**Types of Creatine Supplements**

You can get creatine in different chemical forms or types:

**Creatine monohydrate.** This is the most common type you'll find in supplements. It's also been studied more than other types.

**Creatine ethyl ester.** Experts thought this form might absorb into the body better than creatine monohydrate to make supplements work better. But studies suggest that it doesn't work as well as creatine monohydrate.

**Creatine hydrochloride.** This form dissolves in water better than creatine monohydrate. But there is no evidence that it works better to build muscle as a result.

**Creatine magnesium chelate.** One small study suggested this form could improve sprinting ability in well-trained soccer players. But this form hasn't been studied as much.

**Buffered creatine monohydrate.** One study looked at if a buffered form of creatine monohydrate would get into muscle better to improve exercise capacity more. But the results didn't support that it worked any better or had fewer side effects.

**Liquid creatine.** Creatine monohydrate often comes as a powder. But you can buy it in liquid form, too.

The bottom line is that most studies have looked at creatine monohydrate. There's not much evidence that other forms work better.

Creatine isn't recommended for people with kidney disease, liver disease, or diabetes.

Others who should avoid taking it are children under age 18 and women who are pregnant or nursing.

Don't use creatine if you are taking any medication or supplement that could affect your blood sugar because creatine may also affect blood sugar levels.
