# Hair Porosity

Hair porosity is how well your hair absorbs and retains moisture. It's determined by the condition of the hair cuticle (the outer layer).

There are 3 types:

1. **Low porosity** – Cuticles are tightly closed; resists moisture, slow to dry.

2. **Medium/normal porosity** – Balanced moisture absorption and retention.

3. **High porosity** – Cuticles are raised or damaged; absorbs moisture quickly but loses it fast.

You can test it by placing a clean hair strand in water:

- Floats = low porosity
- Sinks slowly = medium
- Sinks quickly = high
