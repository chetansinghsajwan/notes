# Lean Body Mass

It is the composition of body which includes everything in the body that is not [storage-fat](/health/storage-fat). For example, it includes essential fat, muscles, bones, water, minerals, protiens and organs.

Captain Albert R. Behnke originated the LBM concept in 1942.

**Confusion between Lean Body Mass and Fat Free Mass**

The difference is the LBM inlcudes essential fat, while FFM doesn not. Essential fat is in very small proportion in the body, that the difference between LBM and FFM is very small. Thus the two terms are used interchangibly.
