# Creatine

It was first identified in 1832 by [Michel Eugène Chevreul](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/articles/Michel_Eug%C3%A8ne_Chevreul").

In 1912, [Harvard University](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/articles/Harvard_University "Harvard University") researchers [Otto Folin](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/articles/Otto_Folin "Otto Folin") and [Willey Glover Denis](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/articles/Willey_Glover_Denis "Willey Glover Denis") found evidence that ingesting creatine can dramatically boost the creatine content of the muscle.[](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/articles/Creatine#cite_note-5)[](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/articles/Creatine#cite_note-6) In the late 1920s, after finding that the intramuscular stores of creatine can be increased by ingesting creatine in larger than normal amounts, scientists discovered [phosphocreatine](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/articles/Phosphocreatine "Phosphocreatine") (creatine phosphate),

It is a chemical found naturally in human body.

It is involved in making energy for muscles. About 95% of it is found in skeletal muscle.

About half of your body’s supply of creatine (1 to 2 grams/day, about the size of 1 to 2 jellybeans) comes from your diet, especially protein-rich foods. Your body produces the other half naturally in your [liver](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/21481-liver), [kidneys](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/21824-kidney) and [pancreas](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/21743-pancreas). They deliver about 95% of the creatine to your skeletal muscles to use during physical activity. The rest goes to your [heart](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/21704-heart), [brain](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22638-brain) and other tissues.

Women normally have lesser creatine than men.

**Foods high in creatine**

It's mostly in foods with lots of protein. For example, pork, beef, fish, shellfish, animal milk.

**What happens when you stop taking creatine?**

If you take it and then stop, your levels will go down over a few weeks. Your body will still make it, but you may notice side effects as you get to used to having less creatine. These include:

- Fatigue
- Muscle loss
- Weight loss
