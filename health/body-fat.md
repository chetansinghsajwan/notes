#  Body Fat

Body fat can be classified into two categories:

**Essential Fat**

Essential fat is necessary for normal bodily functioning. Fat in the [bone marrow](https://www.physio-pedia.com/Bone_Marrow "Bone Marrow"), in the heart, lungs, liver, spleen, [kidney](https://www.physio-pedia.com/Kidney "Kidney")s, intestines, [muscle](https://www.physio-pedia.com/Muscle "Muscle")s, and lipid-rich tissues throughout the central nervous system is called essential fat.

**Storage Fat**

Body storage fat refers to all the fat in your body, such as the fat around your organs or abdomen (visceral) and the “jiggly” fat seen under the skin (subcutaneous). Visceral fat (abdominal), is non-essential and having it in excess can increase susceptibility to [chronic illness](https://www.physio-pedia.com/Chronic_Disease "Chronic Disease") and health complications.
