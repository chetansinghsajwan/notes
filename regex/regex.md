# Regex

Regular expressions (regex) were **invented by Stephen Kleene** in the 1950s as part of his work on formal language theory. He introduced them as a way to describe regular languages using what he called "regular sets."

Later, in the 1960sâ€“70s, **Ken Thompson** implemented them in practical computing, notably in Unix tools like `ed` and `grep`, making regex widely used in programming.
