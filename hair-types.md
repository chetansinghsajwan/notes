# Hair Types

The hair typing system was popularized by **Andre Walker**, Oprah Winfrey's hairstylist, in the 1990s. He introduced it mainly for marketing his hair care products.

- **Not scientific**: It's not based on dermatology or biology; it's a **subjective classification**.

- **No standardization**: There's no governing body or scientific institution that validates it.

- **Widely adopted**: Despite its unofficial nature, it's widely used in the beauty industry and natural hair communities for practical reasons (e.g., choosing products or styles).

- **Criticism**: Some criticize it for oversimplifying hair diversity and favoring looser curl types.

Hair types are generally categorized based on curl pattern:

**Type 1: Straight**

- 1A: Fine, very straight, soft
- 1B: Straight with some volume
- 1C: Coarse, straight with body/frizz

**Type 2: Wavy**

- 2A: Loose, fine waves
- 2B: Defined waves with slight frizz
- 2C: Thick, coarse waves, more frizz

**Type 3: Curly**

- 3A: Loose, springy curls
- 3B: Tighter, more defined curls
- 3C: Very tight curls, dense

**Type 4: Coily/Kinky**

- 4A: Soft, tight coils
- 4B: Z-shaped, less defined
- 4C: Very tight, fragile, little definition
