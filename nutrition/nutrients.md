# Nutrients

There are more than 40 different kinds of nutrients in food and they can generally be classified into the following 7 major groups:

1. [Carbohydrates](nutrition/carbohydrates)
2. [Proteins](nutrition/protiens)
3. [Fats](nutrition/fats)
4. [Vitamins](nutrition/vitamins)
5. [Minerals](nutrition/minerals)
6. [Fiber](nutrition/fiber)
7. [Water](nutrition/water)

## Classifications

Nutrients are classified in different ways:

	- Vitamins
	- Minerals

### **2. Based on Function:**

- Energy-yielding nutrients
	- Carbohydrates
	- Fats
	- Proteins

- Body-building nutrients
	- Proteins
	- Minerals (like calcium for bones)

- Regulatory nutrients
	- Vitamins
	- Minerals
	- Water
	- Fibre (helps in digestion)

### **4. Based on Essentiality:**

#### **Essential Nutrients:**

Cannot be synthesized by the body, must be obtained from diet

- Essential amino acids (e.g., lysine)

### **5. Based on Solubility (for vitamins):**

#### **Fat-soluble:**

- Vitamins A, D, E, K
    

#### **Water-soluble:**

- Vitamin C
    
- B-complex vitamins (B1 to B12)
