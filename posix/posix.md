# POSIX

POSIX stands for Portable Operating System Interface.

Itâ€™s a family of standards specified by [IEEE](ieee.md) for maintaining compatibility among operating systems.

It does not define an operating system, it only defines the interface between an application and an operating system.

Therefore, any software that conforms to POSIX standards should be compatible with other operating systems that adhere to the POSIX standards.
