# Internet

**brief**:: Global system of connected computer networks.

It is the global system of interconnected [computer-networks](computer-networks.md) that uses the [ip-suite](internet-protocol/ip-suite.md) to communicate between networks and devices.

It has no single centralized governance in either technological implementation or policies for access and usage; each constituent network sets its own policies.
