# SIM

It stands for Subscriber Identity Module.

It is an integrated circuit to securely store an [imsi](networking/telecom/imsi) number and its related key, which are used to identify and authenticate subscribers on mobile telephone devices.

SIMs are also able to store address book contacts information, and may be protected using a pin code to prevent unauthorized use.

SIMs are always used on [GSM](networking/telecom/gsm) phones, for [CDMA](networking/telecom/cdma) phones, they are needed only for [LTE](networking/telecom/lte) capable handsets.

Technically the actual physical card is known as a [universal integrated circuit card](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/articles/Universal_integrated_circuit_card "Universal integrated circuit card") (UICC); this [smart card](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/articles/Smart_card) is usually made of [PVC](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/articles/Polyvinyl_chloride "Polyvinyl chloride") with embedded contacts and [semiconductors](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/articles/Semiconductor), with the SIM as its primary component. In practice the term "SIM card" is still used to refer to the entire unit and not simply the IC.

A SIM contains a unique serial number, integrated circuit card identification (ICCID), international mobile subscriber identity (IMSI) number, security authentication and ciphering information, temporary information related to the local network, a list of the services the user has access to, and four passwords: a [personal identification number](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/articles/Personal_identification_number "Personal identification number") (PIN) for ordinary use, and a [personal unblocking key](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/articles/Personal_unblocking_key "Personal unblocking key") (PUK) for PIN unlocking as well as a second pair (called PIN2 and PUK2 respectively) which are used for managing [fixed dialing number](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/articles/Fixed_Dialing_Number "Fixed Dialing Number") and some other functionality.[](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/articles/SIM_card#cite_note-4)
