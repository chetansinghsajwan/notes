# Package

To help organize modules and provide a naming hierarchy, Python has a concept of [packages](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-package).

Like file system directories, packages are organized hierarchically, and packages may themselves contain subpackages, as well as regular modules.

Itâ€™s important to keep in mind that all packages are modules, but not all modules are packages. Or put another way, packages are just a special kind of module. Specifically, any module that contains a `__path__` attribute is considered a package.

Python defines two types of packages, [regular packages](regular-package.md) and [namespace packages](namespace-package.md)
