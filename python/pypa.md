# Python Packaging Authority

The Python Packaging Authority (PyPA) is a working group that maintains a core set of software projects used in Python packaging.

The PyPA publishes the [Python Packaging User Guide](https://packaging.python.org), which is **the authoritative resource on how to package, publish, and install Python projects using current tools**.

For a listing of PyPAâ€™s important projects, see [the key projects list](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/key_projects/#pypa-projects "(in Python Packaging User Guide)"). The PyPA hosts projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/pypa), and discusses issues on the [Packaging category on discuss.python.org](https://discuss.python.org/c/packaging).
