# Python Wheel

Wheels make the end-to-end installation of Python packages faster for two reasons:

1. All else being equal, wheels are typically **smaller in size** than source distributions, meaning they can move faster across a network.
2. Installing from wheels directly avoids the intermediate step of **building** packages off of the source distribution.
