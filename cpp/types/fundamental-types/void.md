# `void` type

`void` is used to represent nothing.

It is an [incomplete type](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/incomplete_type) that cannot be completed

There are no objects of `void` type, [arrays](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/array) of `void`, nor [references](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/reference) to `void`. However, [pointers to `void`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/pointer#Pointers_to_void) and [functions](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/function) returning `void` are allowed.
