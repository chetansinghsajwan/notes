# Compound Types

ItÂ is a type that is defined in terms of another type (fundamental types or other compound types).

It is classified as follows:

- [reference types](cpp/types/reference-types.md)
    - [lvalue reference types](cpp/types/compound-types/reference-types/lvalue)
    - [rvalue reference types](cpp/types/compound-types/reference-types/rvalue)
- [pointer types](cpp/types/pointer-types.md)
    - [pointer-to-object types](cpp/types/compound-types/pointer-to-object-types)
    - [pointer-to-function types](cpp/types/compound-types/pointer-to-function-types)
- [pointer-to-member types](cpp/types/pointer-to-member-types.md)
    - [pointer-to-data-member types](cpp/types/compound-types/pointer-to-data-member-types)
    - [pointer-to-member-function types](cpp/types/compound-types/pointer-to-member-function-types)
- [array types](cpp/types/array-types.md)
- [function types](cpp/types/function-types.md)
- [enumeration types](cpp/types/enumeration-types.md)
    - [unscoped enumeration types](cpp/types/compound-types/)
    - [scoped enumeration types](cpp/types/compound-types/)
- [class types](cpp/types/class-types.md)
    - [non-union types](cpp/types/compound-types/non-union-types)
    - [union types](cpp/types/compound-types/union-types)
