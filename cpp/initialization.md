Types of initializations:

- [zero-initialization](zero-initialization.md)
- [default-initialization](default-initialization.md)
- [value-initialization](value-initialization.md)
- [copy-initialization](copy-initialization.md)
- [direct-initialization](direct-initialization.md)
- [list-initialization](list-initialization.md)
- [aggregate-initialization](aggregate-initialization.md)
- [ref-initialization](ref-initialization.md)
- [static-initialization](static-initialization.md)
- [dynamic-initialization](dynamic-initialization.md)
- [constant-initialization](constant-initialization.md)
