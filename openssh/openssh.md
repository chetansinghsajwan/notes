# OpenSSH

The OpenSSH suite consists of the following tools:

- Remote operations are done using [ssh](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1), [scp](https://man.openbsd.org/scp.1), and [sftp](https://man.openbsd.org/sftp.1).
- Key management with [ssh-add](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-add.1), [ssh-keysign](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keysign.8), [ssh-keyscan](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keyscan.1), and [ssh-keygen](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1).
- The service side consists of [sshd](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8), [sftp-server](https://man.openbsd.org/sftp-server.8), and [ssh-agent](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-agent.1).

OpenSSH is developed by a few developers of the [OpenBSD Project](https://www.openbsd.org) and made available under a BSD-style license.

OpenSSH is incorporated into many commercial products, but very few of those companies assist OpenSSH with funding.

Contributions towards OpenSSH can be sent to the [OpenBSD Foundation](https://www.openbsd.org/donations.html).
