Design patterns are typical solutions to common problems in software design. Each pattern is like a blueprint that you can customize to solve a particular design problem in your code.

Software Design Patterns are classified into 3 categories:

1. Creational Patterns
    
    1. [Prototype](prototype.md)
 
2. Structural Patterns
