The Open Source Definition is a set of ten criteria that must be met for software to be considered open source. These criteria were created to ensure that open source software is freely available to everyone and that it remains open and accessible to the community.
The ten criteria, as outlined by the Open Source Initiative (OSI), include:
1. Free distribution: The software must be distributed without any additional charges.
2. Source code: The source code must either be included or easily accessible to the user.
3. Derived Works: Modifications and derived works must be allowed and distributed under the same license as the original software.
4. Integrity of the author's source code: The author's source code must be maintained in its original form, without modification.
5. No discrimination against persons or groups: The software must not discriminate against any person or group.
6. No discrimination against fields of endeavor: The software must be usable in any field, including commercial use.
7. Distribution of license: The rights to the software must apply to everyone who receives it, without needing to obtain additional licenses.
8. License must not be specific to a product: The software cannot be restricted to a specific product.
9. License must not restrict other software: The license cannot restrict other software or technology that is distributed with the software.
10. License must be technology-neutral: The license cannot be specific to any particular technology.
