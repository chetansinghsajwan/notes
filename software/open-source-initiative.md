The Open Source Initiative (OSI) is a non-profit organization dedicated to promoting open-source software.
The organization was founded in late February 1998 by [Bruce Perens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Perens) and [Eric S. Raymond](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_S._Raymond).
One of the primary goals of the OSI is to educate people about the principles of open-source software. These principles include the idea that software should be freely available to use, modify, and distribute without restriction. The OSI also promotes collaboration and community involvement in the development of software.
The OSI is responsible for maintaining the [[open-source-software-definition]].
