**JPEG** ([/ˈdʒeɪpɛɡ/](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English?oldformat=true "Help:IPA/English") [_JAY-peg_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Pronunciation_respelling_key?oldformat=true "Help:Pronunciation respelling key"), short for **Joint Photographic Experts Group**

is a commonly used method of [lossy compression](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/articles/Lossy_compression "Lossy compression") for [digital images](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/articles/Digital_image "Digital image"), particularly for those images produced by [digital photography](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/articles/Digital_photography "Digital photography")

The [Joint Photographic Experts Group](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/articles/Joint_Photographic_Experts_Group "Joint Photographic Experts Group") created the standard in 1992

The degree of compression can be adjusted, allowing a selectable tradeoff between storage size and [image quality](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/articles/Image_quality "Image quality").

JPEG has been the most widely used [image compression](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/articles/Image_compression "Image compression") standard in the world,[](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/articles/JPEG#cite_note-Hudson-4)[](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/articles/JPEG#cite_note-5) and the most widely used digital [image format](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/articles/Image_format "Image format"),

The [MIME media type](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/articles/Internet_media_type "Internet media type") for JPEG is "image/jpeg", except in older [Internet Explorer](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/articles/Internet_Explorer "Internet Explorer") versions, which provide a MIME type of "image/pjpeg

JPEG/JFIF supports a maximum image size of 65,535×65,535 pixels,[](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/articles/JPEG#cite_note-11)

In 2000, the JPEG group introduced a format intended to be a successor, [JPEG 2000](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/articles/JPEG_2000 "JPEG 2000"), but it was unable to replace the original JPEG as the dominant image standard.[](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/articles/JPEG#cite_note-12)

The most common [filename extensions](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/articles/Filename_extension "Filename extension") for files employing JPEG compression are **`.jpg`** and **`.jpeg`**, though `.jpe`, `.jfif` and `.jif` are also used
