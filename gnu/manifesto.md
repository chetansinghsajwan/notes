The GNU Manifesto is a call to action written by Richard Stallman in 1985, outlining his vision for a free software movement. The manifesto begins by describing the problem of proprietary software, which restricts users' freedom and control over their own computers. Stallman argues that software should be considered a public good, like science or mathematics, and that users should have the right to study, modify, and distribute it as they see fit. He goes on to describe the GNU project, which aims to create a complete, free operating system based on this philosophy. The manifesto also includes a plea for programmers to join the project and contribute their time and expertise to the cause of software freedom. Overall, the GNU Manifesto is a passionate and persuasive argument for the importance of free software as a fundamental human right.
