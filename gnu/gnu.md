# GNU

It stands for GNU is Not Unix.

The GNU Project is a mass collaboration project started by [Richard Stallman](people/richard-stallman) in 1983. Its goal is to give computer users freedom and control in their use of their computers and computing devices by collaboratively developing and publishing software that gives everyone the rights to freely run the software, copy and distribute it, study it, and modify it. The project's founding goal was to build a free operating system, and if possible, "everything useful that normally comes with a Unix system so that one could get along without any software that is not free." Development was initiated in January 1984, and the operating system is called GNU.

> **Free** does not mean free of cost. The freedom referred to is the ability of anyone who wishes to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve the software
