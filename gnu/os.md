**GNU** is an [[cs/os]] which is 100% free software. It was launched in 1983 by [richard-stallman](people/richard-stallman) and has been developed by many people working together for the sake of freedom of all software users to control their computing. Technically, GNU is generally like Unix. But unlike [[unix]], GNU gives its users freedom.
