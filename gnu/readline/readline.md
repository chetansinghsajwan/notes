# `readline` Library

It is a library that provides in-line editing and history capabilities for interactive programs with a command-line interface, such as Bash.

`bash` uses readline to read input from the user.

This libray is a part of the gnu project.

It supports two editing modes - emacs and vi.

It reads inputrc from the following locations for configuration:
1. Path specified by `INPUTRC` env variable.
2. If the variable is not set, then reads `~/.inputrc` file.
3. If the above file is not found or read, then reads `/etc/inputrc` file.

See https://tiswww.case.edu/php/chet/readline/readline.html for configuration options.

---
`set -o vi` is a **Bash built-in** that changes **how Bash uses Readline**. Bash uses Readline for input, and this command tells Bash to use **vi keybindings** via Readline.

So while `set` is a Bash command, it **instructs Bash to configure Readline**, which it embeds internally. It doesnâ€™t change `.inputrc`; it changes behavior at runtime.
