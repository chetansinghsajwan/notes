## Bootloader Unlocking

**Bootloader unlocking** is the process of disabling the [bootloader](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Bootloader) security that makes secure boot possible. It can make advanced customizations possible, such as installing a [custom firmware](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Custom_firmware).
- Some bootloaders are not locked at all, others can be unlocked using a standard command, others need assistance from the manufacturer. Some do not include an unlocking method and can only be unlocked through a software [exploit](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Exploit_(computer_security)).
- Bootloader unlocking is also done for [mobile forensics](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Mobile_device_forensics) purposes, to extract [digital evidence](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Digital_evidence) from mobile devices, using tools such as [Cellebrite UFED](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Cellebrite_UFED).
- Unlocking the bootloader usually voids any warranties and may make the device susceptible to data theft.
