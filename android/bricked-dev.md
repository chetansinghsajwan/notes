## Naming Terminology

### Why word 'Brick' in Android terminology was used?

When Android phone isn't operation in anyway, there was a need to name that terminology. Since Android phones are usually in shape of a brick, and since now it isn't fixable in any way, it is as good as a brick. So in that condition, it is called a "Bricked Device".
### Then why there's variations Soft Brick and Hard Brick?

Some people, without understanding history of the word brick in Android terminology, started using it when phones gets into bootloop or boots but ends up at fastboot or recovery. In these kind of situations, phone is fixable. They started opening thread naming "My phone is bricked, help please!" After some people ask in detail it comes to know that phone is suffering from bootloop problem. For them, brick situation was divided into soft brick and hard brick.
So basically Soft Brick is nothing but the problem of bootloop or all type of fixable problems that don't let you boot in to your Android OS.
### Which is common? Hard brick or soft brick?

Hard brick is very very very rare. That shows that soft brick is common. But saying phone is bricked without using word 'Soft' is totally wrong and nooby side. People need to understand why 'Brick' terminology was kept. If your phone is bricked, it is as good as a brick. So even though if chance of hard brick get less than 0.00001% it is totally WRONG to speak word brick for a soft brick.
