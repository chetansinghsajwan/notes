# Scatter File

A Scatter File is a .txt file which is used to describe loads of regions in an android device that is running on a MediaTek’s ARM architecture. Usually, such files are needed at the time of flashing firmware using tools like the [SP Flash Tool](https://www.getdroidtips.com/download-smartphone-flash-tool/). We can easily unbrick an Android Device by flashing the stock Firmware in most of the cases.
