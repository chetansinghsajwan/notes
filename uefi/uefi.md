# UEFI

It stands for Unified Extensible Firmware Interface.

It is an international standard describing a consistent way for firmware on a computing platform to interact with operating systems that are loaded into memory by it.

The standard is maintained by the UEFI Forum, a nonprofit industry standards body, with an open membership.

## A Very Brief History

BIOS was created in the late 1970s to provide load and basic I/O services to operating systems on the original x86 PCs. It became a de facto standard for these x86 PCs and servers. In the late 1990s, new and more complex processor types were becoming available where continued use of BIOS, that is tied to the x86 architecture, just did not make sense. The Extensible Firmware Interface design was created to replace the way BIOS and OSes communicate on systems with Intel CPUs. Eventually, the UEFI Forum was formed in 2005 to make the standard interface more open, broaden its usage, and allow the system firmware community to participate in maintenance and further development of the standard.
