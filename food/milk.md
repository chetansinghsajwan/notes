# Types of Milk

**Pasteurized Milk**

### Why it's done:

- **Kills harmful bacteria** like _Salmonella_, _E. coli_, and _Listeria_.
    
- **Extends shelf life** by reducing microbial load.
    
- **Makes milk safer** for consumption, especially for vulnerable groups (children, elderly, pregnant women).

### Common methods:

1. **High-Temperature Short Time (HTST):**
    
    - Heated to **72°C (161°F)** for **15 seconds**.
        
    - Most common method.
        
2. **Ultra-High Temperature (UHT):**
    
    - Heated to **135°C (275°F)** for **2–5 seconds**.
        
    - Longer shelf life, doesn't require refrigeration until opened.
        
3. **Low-Temperature Long Time (LTLT):**
    
    - Heated to **63°C (145°F)** for **30 minutes**.
        
    - Used less commonly, more for specialty products.
