# `toJson` function

```
toJson <e>
```

Returns a string containing a JSON representation of `e`.

- Strings, integers, floats, booleans, nulls and lists are mapped to their JSON equivalents.

- Sets (except derivations) are represented as objects.

- Derivations are translated to a JSON string containing the derivationâ€™s output path.

- Paths are copied to the store and represented as a JSON string of the resulting store path.
