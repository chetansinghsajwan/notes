# `toString` function

```
toString <e>
```

Convert the expression `e` to a string. `e` can be:

- A string (in which case the string is returned unmodified).

- A path (e.g., `toString /foo/bar` yields `"/foo/bar"`.

- A set containing `{ __toString = self: ...; }` or `{ outPath = ...; }`.

- An integer.

- A list, in which case the string representations of its elements are joined with spaces.

- A Boolean (`false` yields `""`, `true` yields `"1"`).

- `null`, which yields the empty string.
