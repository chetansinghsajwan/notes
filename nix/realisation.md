# Realisation

Realisation is the process whereby a Nix [derivation](https://zero-to-nix.com/concepts/derivations) is transformed into a [package](https://zero-to-nix.com/concepts/packages).

While a derivation is essentially a plan for a package, realisation is the build process turns that plan into an actual output directory full of content.
