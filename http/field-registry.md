# HTTP Field Name Registry

It is a centralized list maintained by [IANA](iana/iana) that defines standard HTTP fields.

The registry is located at https://www.iana.org/assignments/http-fields.

The party generating the registration request should follow the guidelines for the new field name specified at https://httpwg.org/specs/rfc9110.html#considerations.for.new.fields.

Registration requests must include the following information:

- Field name
- Status: "permanent", "provisional", "deprecated", or "obsoleted".
- Specification document(s)

And optionally:

- Comments
- Additional information.

Standards-defined names have a status of "permanent". Other names can also be registered as permanent.
