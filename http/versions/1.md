## HTTP v.9

In 1991, the first documented official version of HTTP was written as a plain document, less than 700 words long, and this version was named HTTP/0.9, which supported only GET method, allowing clients to only retrieve HTML documents from the server, but not supporting any other file formats or information upload.[](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/articles/HTTP#cite_note-HTTP/0.9-specifications-2)
