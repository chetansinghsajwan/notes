# HTTP Headers

**HTTP headers** let the client and the server pass additional information with a message in a request or response.

In `HTTP/1.X`, a header is a case-insensitive name followed by a colon, then optional whitespace which will be ignored, and finally by its value (for example: `Allow: POST`).

Custom proprietary headers have historically been used with an `X-` prefix, but this convention was deprecated in 2012 because of the inconveniences it caused when nonstandard fields became standard.
