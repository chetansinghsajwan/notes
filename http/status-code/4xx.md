# HTTP Status Code 4xx Class

The 4xx (Client Error) class of status code indicates that the client seems to have erred. Except when responding to a HEAD request, the server should send a representation containing an explanation of the error situation, and whether it is a temporary or permanent condition. These status codes are applicable to any request method. User agents should display any included representation to the user.
