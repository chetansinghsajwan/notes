# FUSE

It stands for Filesystem in Userspace.

It is a mechanism for Unix-like operating systems that lets non-privileged users create their own file systems without editing kernel code. This is achieved by running file system code in _user space_, while the FUSE kernel module provides only a "bridge" to the actual kernel interfaces.
