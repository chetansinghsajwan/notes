# Databases

A database is an organized collection of data stored digitally.
A database is usually controlled by a [database management system (DBMS)](https://www.oracle.com/in/database/what-is-database/#WhatIsDBMS).

### Types of databases

- **Relational Databases (RDBMS)**
    
    Organize data into tables with rows and columns. Examples include MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Oracle Database.
    
- **NoSQL Databases**
    
    Designed for handling large sets of unstructured data. Types include document-oriented (MongoDB), key-value stores (Redis), column-family stores (Apache Cassandra), and graph databases (Neo4j).
    
- **Object-Oriented Databases**
    
    Store data in the form of objects, making it easier to work with object-oriented programming languages. Examples include db4o and ObjectDB.
    
- **Graph Databases**
    
    Optimize for storing and querying graph data, where relationships between data points are important. Neo4j is a notable example.
    
- **In-memory Databases**
    
    Store data in the system's main memory (RAM) for faster retrieval. Examples include Redis and SAP HANA.
