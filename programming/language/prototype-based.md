# Prototype Based Language

**Prototype-based programming** is a style of [object-oriented programming](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/OOP) in which [classes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Class) are not explicitly defined, but rather derived by adding properties and methods to an instance of another class or, less frequently, adding them to an empty object.

In simple words: this type of style allows the creation of an [object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Object) without first defining its [class](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Class).
