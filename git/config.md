# Git Config

Git divides the configuration in three levels:

1. System Level
2. Global or User Level
3. Local Level

System Level is applied throughout the whole system, for each user. The configuration file for this level is stored at `/etc/gitconfig` file.

Global Level is applied specific to one user. global level, the configuration file is stored at `~/.gitconfig` or `~/.config/git/config`. This level is specific to each user.

For local level
