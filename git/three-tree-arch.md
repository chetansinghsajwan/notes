# The Three Tree Architecture

Git refers to these three elements as trees:

- [Head](git/head)
- [Index](git/index)
- Working Directory

They don't actually follow tree structure but they are conceptually referred as trees.

## Working Directory

Working Tree is the root folder, where you work. This is where all your current changes are.
