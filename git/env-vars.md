# Git Environment Variables

**Todo**:: List the important environment variables here.

- **`GIT_EXEC_PATH`**
	
	Determines where Git looks for its sub-programs (like `git-commit`, `git-diff`, and others). You can check the current setting by running `git --exec-path`.

- **`HOME`** isn’t usually considered customizable (too many other things depend on it), but it’s where Git looks for the global configuration file.
