# Unix Operating System

Unix is a computer operating system developed in the 1970s at Bell Labs by Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie, and others. It was designed to be portable, multi-user, and multi-tasking, and has become one of the most widely used operating systems in the world.

It is comprised of **Unix Kernel**.

It is not **open source**.

The word "UNIX" refers to an operating system specification and also the original implementation of it at Bell Labs.

## History

**1969:** Dennis Ritchie and Ken Thompson working at bell labs like to play Space Travel on the big General Electric mainframe running Multics. However, compute time on the Multics machine is stupidly expensive, so they write a small OS for an old PDP-7 so they can play video game better.

**1970:** The OS is named Unics (pun on Multics and eunuchs since it's a "castrated multics")

**1973:** The OS is rewritten in an early form of C and now runs on PDP-11. The spelling has changed to Unix at some point

**1973:** The system has progressed to version 5 and AT&T publicly releases it, starts licensing to educational institutions. Version 6 is sold to companies as well.

**1977:** University of California, Berkeley, a (relatively) long-time user of Unix releases their improvements on the base system. Unix systems with these improvements come to be called Berkeley Software Distribution or BSD for short and can be copied and installed for free by anyone with a Unix license.

1979: Unix V7 and Unix/32V released. Unix systems get largely divided into BSD and V7 branches

Early 1980s: Unix V8, V9, V10 are created, dubbed Research Unix. Not commercially particularly notable, but important research systems that lead toward Plan 9 from Bell Labs

1981: System III evolves from V7
- 1983: System III developed further into System V, which is to become the basis for most commercial Unix systems (followed by BSD)
- 1983: The development of the GNU System (GNU's Not Unix) started to create a free Unix-style operating system
- Mid 1980s: several vendors bring out their Unix systems: IBM's AIX, Sun Microsystems' SunOS, Microsoft's Xenix and HP's HP-UX
- 1987: Andrew Tanenbaum creates Minix, a PC-based Unix clone for OS concept education. Does not use AT&T's codebase.
- 1991: Linux 0.0.1 released, an independent Unix-like kernel clone written by a Finnish CS student, GNU libraries and utilities are later ported to it.
- 1992: AT&T sues BSDi over their intellectual property
- 1992: SunOS changes from BSD base to System V Release 4 base and rebrands as Solaris
- 1993: 4.4BSD-lite released, a (nearly) complete system with no AT&T Unix base required. FreeBSD and NetBSD forked from 386BSD, an earlier port of BSD for Intel 80386-based PCs
- 1997: Linux 2.0 Released
- 1998: OpenBSD forked from NetBSD
- Present: Original implementation of unix is no longer used, but itâ€™s derivatives and variants are used.
