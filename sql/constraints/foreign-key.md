# `FOREIGN KEY` Constraint

The `FOREIGN KEY` constraint is used to prevent actions that would destroy links between tables.

A `FOREIGN KEY` is a field (or collection of fields) in one table, that refers to the [`PRIMARY KEY`](sql/primary-key) in another table.

The table with the foreign key is called the child table, and the table with the primary key is called the referenced or parent table.
