# SQL

SQL is a programming language used to manage a database. It can read, write data and control access to it.
  
##### Statement

A statement is a single, well-formed instruction that performs a specific operation on a database. It can be a query, data manipulation operation, or a data definition operation.

##### Query
A query is a specific type of statement used to retrieve data from a database. It typically involves the SELECT keyword and is designed to fetch information based on specified criteria.

##### Clause

A clause is a component of a SQL statement that provides additional information about how the statement should be executed or what data should be affected. Common clauses include WHERE, ORDER BY, and GROUP BY.

##### Function

An function is a predefined operation that takes one or more arguments, performs a specific computation, and returns a result. Functions can be used in SQL statements for tasks like mathematical operations, string manipulation, and date/time calculations.

##### Expression

An expression is a combination of one or more values, operators, and SQL functions that evaluates to a single value.
