# Richard Stallman

Richard Stallman is a computer programmer and software freedom activist who was born on March 16, 1953 in New York City, USA. He is best known for his role in founding the Free Software Foundation and creating the GNU operating system.

Stallman began programming in the early 1970s at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), where he became a prominent member of the hacker community. He worked on various projects, including the development of the first Emacs text editor, which he released as free software in 1985.

In 1983, Stallman announced his intention to create a completely free and open-source operating system, which he called GNU (GNU's Not Unix). 

He worked tirelessly on this project for many years, developing important software components such as the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) and the GNU Debugger.

Stallman's advocacy for free and open-source software has been a driving force in the tech industry for decades. He has been a vocal opponent of proprietary software and has argued that users should have the right to modify and distribute software as they see fit.

Stallman's contributions to the world of technology have been widely recognized. He has been awarded numerous honors and awards, including the ACM Grace Hopper Award in 1991 and the Electronic Frontier Foundation's Pioneer Award in 1998.

Today, Stallman continues to be an active member of the free software community. He travels the world giving talks and advocating for software freedom, and his work continues to inspire generations of programmers and activists.
