## Protocols for Real Time Interactive Applications

### RTP

RTP stands for Realtime Transport Protocol.

RTP can be used for transporting common formats for sound and MPEG and H.263 for video.

It can also be used for transporting proprietary sound and video formats.

RTP typically runs on top of UDP. The sending side encapsulates a media chunk within an RTP packet, then encapsulates the packet in a UDP segment, and then hands the segment to IP. The receiving side extracts the RTP packet from the UDP segment, then extracts the media chunk from the RTP packet, and then passes the chunk to the media player for decoding and rendering.

RTP is a packet-based protocol, which means that it breaks the media stream into packets for transmission over the network.

RTP is used in conjunction with the Real-time Transport Control Protocol (RTCP), which is used to monitor the quality of the data transmission. RTP provides the actual delivery of the media, while RTCP is used to provide feedback on the quality of the transmission and to provide other control information.

###### Applications of RTP

1. RTP mainly helps in media mixing, sequencing and time-stamping.
2. Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP)
3. Video Teleconferencing over Internet.
4. Internet Audio and video streaming.

### RTCP

RTCP stands for RTP Control Protocol.

It's used with RTP. While RTP is used for actual data transmission, it's used to control the transmission.

The purpose of monitoring delivery is to determine whether RTP is providing the necessary Quality of Service and to compensate for delays, if needed.

This is done by sending special RTCP messages.

There are 5 types of messages:

1. **SR**
    
    SR stands for Sendor Report.
    
    This report is sent by sender again and again to report about the transmission.

2. **RR**
    
    RR stands for Reciever Report.
    
    The receiver report is for passive participants, those that do not send RTP packets. Passive participants are those participants that do not send RTP packets.
    
    The report informs the sender and other receivers about the quality of service.

3. **SDES**
    
    SDES stands for Sourse Description Message.
    
    The source sends a source description message within a fixed interval to give some extra information about itself.

4. **BYE**
    
    The source sends the BYE message to notfiy the participants about the end of the data flow.

5. **APP**
    
    APP stands for Application Specific Message.
    
    It is just to be used for experimental purposes and newly emerging features and functions.

### SIP

SIP stands for Session Intiation Protocol, defined by IETF.

SIP is a signalling protocol used to create, modify, and terminate a multimedia session over the Internet Protocol.

It is an application layer protocol. It was designed to be independent of underlying transport layer, so it ca run on UDP or TCP.

It provides mechanisms for establishing calls between a caller and a callee over an IP network.

It provieds mechanisms for the caller to derermine the current IP address of the callee.

It provides mechanisms for call management, such as adding new media streams during the call, changing the encoding during the call, inviting new participants during the call, call transfer, and call holding.

###### SIP Applications

- file transfer
- instant messaging
- video conferencing
- online games
- steaming multimedia distribution

##### SIP Address

In SIP, the sender and receiver are often identified by any of these.

1. An Email address.
2. An IP address.
3. A Phone number

##### SIP Messages

1. INVITE: It requests for initiation of a session.
2. ACK: It confirms that session has initiated.
3. BYE: It request for the termination of the session.
4. OPTIONS: It query a host about its capabilities.
5. CANCEL: It will cancel the pending request.
6. REGISTER: It informs a redirection server about the userâ€™s current location.

##### SIP Session

It's a three step process:

1. Establishing a session:
    
    It requires a three-way handshake. The caller will send INVITE message. If the caller is willing to start out, he/she sends a reply message. to verify that a reply code is received, the caller send an ACK message.

2. Communication:
    
    After establishment of session, the caller and callee communicate using two temporary ports.

3. Terminating the session:
    
    The session can often terminated by using BYE message send by either caller or callee.

### H.323 Protocols

H.323 is a set of standards for real-time communication over IP networks.

It was developed by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) in the late 1990s.

Some protocols that H.323 includes:

- **G.711**: Used for compression.
    
- **H.225**: Used for signaling, which is the process of establishing and maintaining communication sessions.
    
- **H.245**: Used for control, which is the process of managing the communication session.
    
- **RAS**: Used to establish and maintain connections between devices.
    
- **RTCP**: Used to control RTP channels.
    
- **RTP**: Used for actual data tranmission.

#### Differences between SIP and H.323

- H.323 is a complete, vertically integrated suite of protocols for multimedia conferencing, signalling, registration, admission control, transport, and codes. SIP addresses only session initiation and management and is a single component.

- H.323 comes from the ITU, whereas SIP comes from the IETF and borrows many concepts from the Web, DNS, and Internet e-mail.

- H.323 is large and complex. SIP uses the KISS principle: keep it simple, stupid.

#### Class Of Service

Also called as CoS.

Class of Service is a way to manage different types of traffic over a network by dividing similar types of traffic by classes.

It prioritizes traffic by allocating different levels of priority to different groups.

For example, it can give more priority to the voice traffic over others such as email or HTTP traffic. This enables network managers to refine connections to meet specific application needs.

CoS operates at layer 2 of the OSI model.

#### Quality Of Service

Also called as QoS.

Quality of Service refers to the set of technologies used to manage network resources by allocating application of different network behaviors to different traffic types.

QoS is all about traffic shaping and prioritizing traffic.

QoS is not a standalone service or product but rather a concept that allows for allocation of network resources for important applications or traffic.

QoS operates at layer 3 of the OSI model.
