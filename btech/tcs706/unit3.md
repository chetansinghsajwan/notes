## Knowledge representation

It refers to the process of encoding information in a form that can be utilized by a computer program.

It involves selecting a suitable language or structure to represent knowledge in a way that allows the AI system to manipulate, reason about, and draw inferences from that knowledge.

##### What to Represent

Following are the kind of knowledge which needs to be represented in AI systems:

- **Object**: All the facts about objects in our world domain.
	
	E.g., Guitars contains strings, trumpets are brass instruments.

- **Events**: Events are the actions which occur in our world.

- **Performance**: It describe behavior which involves knowledge about how to do things.

- **Meta-knowledge**: It is knowledge about what we know.

- **Facts**: Facts are the truths about the real world and what we represent.

- **Knowledge-Base**: The central component of the knowledge-based agents is the knowledge base. It is represented as KB. The Knowledgebase is a group of the Sentences (Here, sentences are used as a technical term and not identical with the English language).

##### Types of Knowledge

**4. Heuristic knowledge:**
