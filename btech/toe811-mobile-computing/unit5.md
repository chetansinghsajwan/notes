### Ad Hoc Networks: Explained Like You're 5

Imagine you're playing in a big playground with your friends, but there's no adult to organize the games or give instructions. Instead, you and your friends decide on your own how to play and communicate with each other. This is a bit like how ad hoc networks work.

#### What are Ad Hoc Networks?

Ad hoc networks are like playgrounds where devices (like phones or computers) can talk directly to each other without needing a central hub or control point (like a Wi-Fi router).

#### Key Features:

1. **No Central Control:**
    
    - Just like there’s no teacher to tell you what to do, there’s no central device controlling the communication.
2. **Direct Communication:**
    
    - Devices talk directly to each other, like you and your friends shouting messages across the playground.
3. **Flexible and Changing:**
    
    - Friends (or devices) can come and go anytime. The group (network) changes as people move around.
4. **Helping Each Other:**
    
    - If you want to send a message to a friend far away, other friends in between can pass along the message, like a relay race.

#### Why Use Ad Hoc Networks?

1. **Quick Setup:**
    
    - Just like you can start playing a game quickly without needing a teacher, ad hoc networks can be set up quickly without needing special infrastructure.
2. **Independence:**
    
    - If there’s no Wi-Fi router or it’s not working, devices can still communicate directly with each other.

#### Examples:

- **Playground Games:** If one friend wants to send a message to another far away, kids in between can pass the message along.
- **Walkie-Talkies:** Like kids using walkie-talkies to talk directly to each other without a central station.

#### Advantages:

1. **Flexibility:**
    
    - You can play games anywhere, anytime, with any number of friends.
2. **No Need for Extra Equipment:**
    
    - You don’t need to set up a big, fancy game or have an adult to play.
3. **Stays Connected:**
    
    - Even if some friends leave the game, the rest can still play and communicate.

#### Challenges:

1. **Sharing:**
    
    - Just like you have to share toys, devices have to share the airwaves to talk, which can cause interference or confusion.
2. **Finding the Way:**
    
    - Figuring out how to pass messages (routing) can get tricky if there are many friends and lots of messages.
3. **Security:**
    
    - Without an adult, it’s harder to make sure everyone follows the rules and stays safe from bullies.

### Summary

Ad hoc networks are a way for devices to talk directly to each other without needing a central controller, much like kids playing and communicating directly in a playground. They are flexible and quick to set up but come with challenges like managing shared resources and ensuring security.

## MAC Issues

MAC (Media Access Control) issues in mobile computing pertain to challenges and problems related to the Media Access Control layer, which is responsible for controlling how devices in a network access the physical medium. The MAC layer is crucial in ensuring efficient, fair, and reliable communication in wireless networks. Here are some common MAC issues in mobile computing:

#### 1. **Collisions and Contention**

- **Collision:** When two or more devices attempt to send data simultaneously on the same channel, their signals collide, causing data loss.
- **Contention:** Multiple devices competing for access to the same communication medium can lead to delays and reduced network efficiency.

#### 2. **Hidden and Exposed Terminal Problems**

- **Hidden Terminal Problem:** Occurs when two devices cannot detect each other’s signals due to their distance or obstacles, but they both communicate with a third device. This can cause collisions at the third device.
- **Exposed Terminal Problem:** Occurs when a device refrains from sending data because it mistakenly believes that the medium is busy due to another device’s transmission that will not cause interference.

#### 3. **Channel Access and Fairness**

- **Unfair Access:** Ensuring that all devices get fair access to the communication channel can be challenging, especially in dense networks where some devices may dominate the medium.
- **Channel Utilization:** Efficiently utilizing the available bandwidth and reducing idle time are critical for maintaining network performance.

#### 4. **Power Consumption**

- **Energy Efficiency:** Managing power consumption is crucial for mobile devices, which often rely on battery power. MAC protocols must balance energy efficiency with performance.
- **Idle Listening:** Devices consuming power while waiting for potential transmissions can drain the battery unnecessarily.

#### 5. **Interference and Noise**

- **Interference:** External signals from other devices, networks, or electronic equipment can interfere with communication, leading to errors and reduced performance.
- **Noise:** Background noise can degrade signal quality, increasing the likelihood of errors and the need for retransmissions.

#### 6. **Scalability and Mobility**

- **Scalability:** As the number of devices in a network increases, the MAC protocol must efficiently manage communication to prevent congestion and maintain performance.
- **Mobility:** Mobile devices frequently change their location, which can lead to frequent handoffs, changes in network topology, and the need for dynamic adjustment of MAC parameters.

#### 7. **Security Issues**

- **Eavesdropping:** Unauthorized interception of data can compromise privacy and security.
- **MAC Spoofing:** Malicious devices can impersonate other devices by spoofing their MAC addresses, potentially gaining unauthorized access or disrupting network communication.

#### 8. **QoS (Quality of Service)**

- **Prioritization:** Ensuring that high-priority traffic (e.g., VoIP, streaming) gets preferential access to the medium while maintaining fair access for all devices.
- **Latency and Jitter:** Minimizing delays and variations in delay to maintain the quality of real-time communications.

## Routing Protocols

Routing protocols are essential for determining the optimal paths for data transmission across a network. In mobile computing, especially in dynamic and often decentralized networks, these protocols are designed to handle frequent topology changes, limited bandwidth, and varying device mobility. Here’s a look at some common routing protocols used in mobile computing:

#### 1. **Proactive (Table-Driven) Routing Protocols**

Proactive routing protocols maintain up-to-date routing information to all nodes by periodically distributing routing tables throughout the network. This ensures that routes are readily available whenever needed, albeit at the cost of constant control message overhead.

- **Examples:**
    - **DSDV (Destination-Sequenced Distance-Vector Routing):**
        - Each node maintains a routing table with the next hop and distance to each destination.
        - Sequence numbers are used to prevent routing loops and ensure the freshness of routes.
    - **OLSR (Optimized Link State Routing):**
        - Uses hello and topology control messages to discover and disseminate link state information.
        - Employs MultiPoint Relays (MPRs) to reduce the number of transmissions required for control messages.

#### 2. **Reactive (On-Demand) Routing Protocols**

Reactive routing protocols create routes only when desired by the source node. This reduces the overhead from maintaining up-to-date routes but can lead to initial delays when establishing a new route.

- **Examples:**
    - **AODV (Ad hoc On-Demand Distance Vector):**
        - Discovers routes on-demand using route request (RREQ) and route reply (RREP) messages.
        - Utilizes sequence numbers to ensure the freshness of routes and prevent loops.
    - **DSR (Dynamic Source Routing):**
        - Uses source routing, where the packet carries the entire route to the destination.
        - Route discovery and route maintenance processes handle finding and preserving routes.

#### 3. **Hybrid Routing Protocols**

Hybrid routing protocols combine the advantages of both proactive and reactive approaches to provide scalable and efficient routing. These protocols typically divide the network into zones or clusters.

- **Examples:**
    - **ZRP (Zone Routing Protocol):**
        - Combines proactive routing within a local zone and reactive routing between zones.
        - Reduces control overhead while ensuring quick route discovery for local communications.
    - **HSR (Hierarchical State Routing):**
        - Creates a multi-level hierarchy, where nodes at each level have different responsibilities for route maintenance and discovery.

#### 4. **Geographic Routing Protocols**

Geographic routing protocols use the physical location of nodes to make routing decisions. These protocols require nodes to be aware of their own and their neighbors' locations, often using GPS.

- **Examples:**
    - **GPSR (Greedy Perimeter Stateless Routing):**
        - Uses greedy forwarding where packets are forwarded to the neighbor closest to the destination.
        - If greedy forwarding fails, perimeter routing (face routing) is used to traverse the network.
    - **GAF (Geographic Adaptive Fidelity):**
        - Divides the network into a virtual grid, with only a few nodes active in each grid area to save energy.

#### 5. **Energy-Aware Routing Protocols**

Energy-aware routing protocols aim to extend the network's lifetime by optimizing routes based on the nodes' remaining battery life.

- **Examples:**
    - **EAR (Energy-Aware Routing):**
        - Selects routes based on the energy levels of nodes, preferring routes that consume less power.
    - **LEACH (Low-Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy):**
        - Uses a clustering-based approach where cluster heads are rotated to balance energy consumption.

#### 6. **QoS-Aware Routing Protocols**

Quality of Service (QoS)-aware routing protocols focus on ensuring certain performance metrics, such as delay, bandwidth, and packet loss, are met.

- **Examples:**
    - **AQOR (Adaptive QoS-based Routing):**
        - Adapts routes based on QoS requirements and current network conditions.
    - **MMSPEED (Multi-Path and Multi-SPEED Routing):**
        - Uses multiple paths and varying speeds to meet different QoS requirements, such as delay and reliability.

## Global State Routing (GSR)

Global State Routing (GSR) is a proactive routing protocol designed for mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs). It maintains global state information to ensure efficient routing of packets across the network. By periodically exchanging link state information among nodes, GSR helps in maintaining up-to-date routing tables.

#### Key Features of GSR

1. **Proactive Routing:**
    
    - GSR is a table-driven protocol that maintains fresh routes to all possible destinations in the network by periodically updating routing tables.
2. **Global State Information:**
    
    - Each node maintains a complete view of the network topology by collecting link state information from other nodes.
3. **Link State Updates:**
    
    - Nodes exchange link state information periodically, allowing them to update their routing tables with the latest network topology.
4. **Routing Tables:**
    
    - Every node maintains a routing table that contains the next hop and the shortest path to each destination node.

#### How GSR Works

1. **Link State Advertisement (LSA):**
    
    - Each node periodically broadcasts its link state information to all other nodes in the network.
    - The link state information includes the node’s current neighbors and the status of these links.
2. **Building Routing Tables:**
    
    - Upon receiving LSA messages from other nodes, each node updates its local routing table.
    - The routing table contains entries for each destination node, including the next hop and the cost (e.g., number of hops) to reach the destination.
3. **Route Calculation:**
    
    - Routes are calculated using algorithms like Dijkstra's algorithm, which finds the shortest path based on the collected link state information.
4. **Packet Forwarding:**
    
    - When a node needs to forward a packet, it consults its routing table to determine the next hop towards the destination.
    - The packet is then forwarded to the appropriate next hop node.

#### Advantages of GSR

1. **Up-to-Date Routing Information:**
    
    - Nodes have current knowledge of the network topology, ensuring that packets are routed efficiently.
2. **Loop-Free Routing:**
    
    - By using consistent and accurate global state information, GSR prevents routing loops.
3. **Efficient for Stable Networks:**
    
    - GSR performs well in networks with moderate mobility, where the network topology does not change too frequently.

#### Disadvantages of GSR

1. **High Control Overhead:**
    
    - Periodic exchange of link state information can lead to significant control message overhead, especially in large networks.
2. **Scalability Issues:**
    
    - Maintaining global state information and large routing tables can become challenging as the network size increases.
3. **Latency in Highly Dynamic Networks:**
    
    - In networks with high mobility, the frequency of topology changes can cause delays in updating routing tables, leading to temporary routing inconsistencies.

## Destination sequenced distance vector routing (DSDVR)

Destination Sequenced Distance Vector (DSDV) routing is a proactive routing protocol specifically designed for use in ad hoc mobile networks. It is an enhancement over the traditional distance vector routing protocol, incorporating several features to handle the rapidly changing network topology of a mobile environment.

#### Key Features of DSDV

1. **Table-Driven Approach:**
    
    - DSDV operates by maintaining a routing table at each node, which stores all available destinations, the number of hops to reach the destination, and the next hop router for each route.
2. **Sequence Numbers:**
    
    - Each entry in the routing table is tagged with a sequence number, which is originated by the destination node. This sequence number helps to distinguish stale routes from new ones, ensuring loop-free and up-to-date routing information.
3. **Periodic Updates:**
    
    - Nodes periodically transmit their routing tables to their immediate neighbors. This periodic update helps to ensure that all nodes maintain a consistent view of the network.
4. **Triggered Updates:**
    
    - If there are significant changes in the network topology, a node can send triggered updates. These updates are sent immediately to inform other nodes of the change, rather than waiting for the next periodic update.

#### How DSDV Works

1. **Route Initialization:**
    
    - When the network is initialized, each node creates a routing table that lists all possible destinations within the network, the distance (in hops) to each destination, the next hop node, and the sequence number associated with the route.
2. **Route Updates:**
    
    - Each node periodically transmits its routing table to its neighbors. This broadcast includes the node’s entire routing table.
    - If a node receives a routing update that contains a new route or an existing route with a higher sequence number, or the same sequence number but a better metric (fewer hops), it updates its own routing table.
3. **Route Maintenance:**
    
    - If a route becomes unusable (e.g., due to node mobility), the node increments the sequence number and sets an infinite metric (hop count) on the route before broadcasting it to its neighbors. This ensures that the route is avoided in future updates.

#### Advantages of DSDV

1. **Loop-Free Routing:**
    
    - The use of sequence numbers ensures that the routes are loop-free and up-to-date, as newer routes always have higher sequence numbers.
2. **Predictable Route Discovery Time:**
    
    - Since routes are maintained continuously, the route discovery time is predictable and there is no need for route discovery procedures in the case of new traffic demands.

#### Disadvantages of DSDV

1. **Overhead from Periodic Broadcasts:**
    
    - The periodic transmission of the entire routing table can lead to significant overhead, consuming bandwidth and battery power.
2. **Slow Reaction to Topological Changes:**
    
    - Although triggered updates can somewhat mitigate this issue, there can still be a delay before the loss of a link is propagated throughout the network.
3. **Scalability Issues:**
    
    - The performance of DSDV degrades as the number of network nodes increases. This is due to the larger routing tables that must be maintained and periodically transmitted.

## Dynamic source routing (DSR)

Dynamic Source Routing (DSR) is a reactive routing protocol used primarily in ad hoc mobile networks. Unlike proactive protocols, such as DSDV, which maintain a constant update of routes in the network, DSR creates routes only when desired by a source node initiating a data transfer. This on-demand nature can significantly reduce the overhead and bandwidth consumption in networks with sporadic or infrequent data transfers.

#### Key Features of DSR

1. **On-Demand Route Discovery:**
    
    - DSR does not require periodic route advertisement or routing table maintenance. Routes are discovered dynamically through a route discovery process initiated by the source node when it needs to send data.
2. **Route Caching:**
    
    - Nodes cache routing information as they receive route replies or learn about routes during other routing activities. This cache can store multiple routes for any destination, reducing the need for frequent route discoveries.
3. **Source Routing:**
    
    - The entire route from source to destination is included in the packet header. This allows intermediate nodes to route the packet without needing to maintain up-to-date routing information.

#### How DSR Works

1. **Route Discovery:**
    
    - When a source node wants to send a packet to a destination for which it does not have a route, it initiates a route discovery by broadcasting a route request packet. This packet contains the destination address and a unique identification number.
    - Each node that receives the route request checks if it knows a route to the destination. If not, it adds its own address to the route record in the packet header and forwards the packet along.
2. **Route Reply:**
    
    - If the route request reaches a node that has recent route information about the destination or the destination node itself, the recipient generates a route reply packet. This packet contains the sequence of network hops through which the packet can be delivered.
    - The route reply is then sent back to the source node using the route recorded in the route request, or through a direct route if available.
3. **Route Maintenance:**
    
    - If a link on a source route breaks, the node detecting the failure sends a route error packet to the original source node. The source can then use another route from its cache or initiate a new route discovery if needed.

#### Advantages of DSR

1. **Reduced Overhead:**
    
    - By eliminating the need for periodic route advertisement, DSR can significantly reduce the overhead in mobile ad hoc networks, especially in networks with low to moderate traffic levels.
2. **Flexible Route Management:**
    
    - The use of route caching allows for quick adaptation to changing network conditions without needing to initiate route discovery frequently.
3. **Capability to Support Multiple Routes:**
    
    - The route caching mechanism in DSR allows nodes to learn multiple routes to any destination, providing redundancy and load balancing.

#### Disadvantages of DSR

1. **Route Discovery Latency:**
    
    - Route discovery in DSR can introduce latency, as routes are only determined when required. This can affect the performance in highly dynamic networks where frequent route discoveries might be necessary.
2. **Scalability Issues:**
    
    - The scalability of DSR can be limited in large networks due to the potentially large size of route request packets, as they need to carry the addresses of all nodes they pass through.
3. **Resource Consumption Due to Caching:**
    
    - The effectiveness of route caching is dependent on the stability of the network. High mobility can lead to frequent invalidation of cached routes, requiring more frequent updates and management.

## Ad Hoc on demand distance vector routing (AODVR)

Ad Hoc On-Demand Distance Vector (AODV) routing is a popular reactive routing protocol used in mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs). Unlike proactive protocols that maintain consistent, up-to-date routing information about every part of the network, AODV creates routes only when they are needed for data transmission. This approach reduces the overhead involved in maintaining routes that might not be used, saving bandwidth and battery life in mobile environments.

#### Key Features of AODV

1. **On-Demand Route Establishment:**
    
    - AODV minimizes the number of broadcasts by creating routes on an as-needed basis with a route discovery process.
2. **Route Maintenance:**
    
    - It uses route error messages and route reply messages to ensure that the routing overhead is low and the routes are loop-free.
3. **Sequence Numbers:**
    
    - Each route entry carries a sequence number to ensure the freshness of the route and to prevent routing loops.
4. **Hop-by-Hop Routing:**
    
    - Routing information is maintained at each intermediate node, facilitating easy route setup and maintenance.

#### How AODV Works

1. **Route Discovery:**
    
    - When a source node requires a route to a destination for which it does not have a route, it broadcasts a Route Request (RREQ) packet across the network.
    - Nodes receiving this packet update their information for the reverse route back to the source node. If the receiving node is either the destination or has a route to the destination with a fresh enough sequence number, it will reply back with a Route Reply (RREP) packet.
2. **Route Establishment:**
    
    - If intermediate nodes receive the RREQ, they either forward the request further (if they do not have a fresh route to the destination) or send a RREP back to the source node via the reverse path if they have a valid route to the destination.
3. **Route Maintenance:**
    
    - If a node along the route moves, causing a link break, the node upstream of the break sends a Route Error (RERR) message to the source node to notify it of the break.
    - Upon receiving the RERR, the source may decide to re-initiate the route discovery process if the route is still needed.

#### Advantages of AODV

1. **Efficient Use of Bandwidth:**
    
    - By not requiring periodic route advertisement, AODV uses bandwidth more efficiently than classical routing protocols.
2. **Dynamic Link Conditions:**
    
    - It adapts quickly to dynamic link conditions, reducing the need for frequent route updates.
3. **Reduced Control Overhead:**
    
    - It maintains only the routes that are actively needed, which reduces the control overhead significantly compared to proactive protocols.

#### Disadvantages of AODV

1. **Latency in Route Discovery:**
    
    - Route discovery process can introduce initial delays in route setup, which might not be suitable for real-time applications.
2. **Increased Overhead with Mobility:**
    
    - High mobility can lead to frequent route errors and the need for new routes, increasing the overhead.
3. **Scalability Issues:**
    
    - As network size increases, the control messages for route discovery and maintenance can consume a significant portion of network bandwidth.

## Optimized link state routing protocol (OLSR)

Optimized Link State Routing Protocol (OLSR) is a proactive routing protocol designed for mobile ad hoc networks. Unlike reactive routing protocols that establish routes on-demand, OLSR continuously exchanges link state information among the nodes to establish and maintain routes. This proactive nature ensures that every node has routing information to every other node in the network at all times, facilitating immediate data transmission without the need for route discovery processes.

#### Key Features of OLSR

1. **Proactive Route Management:**
    
    - OLSR continuously maintains fresh lists of routes, which reduces latency because routes are ready when needed, eliminating the need for route discovery.
2. **MultiPoint Relays (MPRs):**
    
    - A unique feature of OLSR is the use of MultiPoint Relays. MPRs are selected nodes that forward broadcast messages during the flooding process. This reduces the number of transmissions required and minimizes the broadcast overhead.
3. **Optimized Flooding:**
    
    - The use of MPRs ensures that the control traffic is significantly reduced compared to traditional link state protocols which flood the network with updates.
4. **Link State Database:**
    
    - Each node in the network maintains a link state database that contains the latest state of each link as known through the network. This database is updated regularly and is used to compute the next hop for each destination.

#### How OLSR Works

1. **Hello Messages:**
    
    - Each node periodically sends Hello messages to detect and maintain neighbor relations. These messages also help in selecting MPRs among the neighbors based on their willingness and link quality.
2. **Topology Control (TC) Messages:**
    
    - These messages are generated by nodes selected as MPRs. TC messages are used to disseminate information about link states throughout the network, specifically the MPR selectors of the nodes.
3. **Route Calculation:**
    
    - Every node uses the information in its link state database to calculate efficient routing paths using shortest path algorithms like Dijkstra’s algorithm.

#### Advantages of OLSR

1. **Low Latency in Data Transmission:**
    
    - Since routes are maintained constantly, data packets do not suffer from the initial delay typical of route discovery in reactive protocols.
2. **Efficient Use of Bandwidth:**
    
    - The use of MPRs significantly reduces the number of transmissions needed to flood control messages across the network.
3. **Suitable for Large Networks:**
    
    - The proactive nature and optimization strategies like MPR make OLSR more suitable for larger networks compared to other ad hoc routing protocols.

#### Disadvantages of OLSR

1. **Higher Overhead in Low Mobility Scenarios:**
    
    - The constant exchange of messages and maintenance of routing tables may lead to higher overhead in scenarios where network topology does not change frequently.
2. **Resource Consumption:**
    
    - The continuous sending of control messages consumes more power and bandwidth, which can be disadvantageous in energy-constrained environments.
3. **Complexity in MPR Selection:**
    
    - The selection and maintenance of MPRs add complexity to the protocol, requiring more sophisticated mechanisms in the nodes.

## QoS in Ad Hoc Networks

Quality of Service (QoS) in ad hoc networks refers to the ability to provide different levels of performance to different types of traffic, applications, or users. QoS mechanisms in ad hoc networks are essential for ensuring that the network can meet the diverse requirements of various applications, such as voice and video streaming, real-time gaming, and data transfer, while maintaining acceptable levels of reliability, latency, and throughput. Here are some key aspects of QoS in ad hoc networks:

### Challenges in Providing QoS in Ad Hoc Networks

1. **Dynamic Topology:** Ad hoc networks are characterized by rapidly changing topologies due to node mobility, which makes it challenging to maintain stable routes with consistent QoS parameters.
    
2. **Limited Bandwidth:** Ad hoc networks often operate in environments with limited bandwidth, requiring efficient allocation and management of resources to meet QoS requirements.
    
3. **Resource Constraints:** Nodes in ad hoc networks typically have limited battery power, processing capabilities, and memory, which must be taken into account when implementing QoS mechanisms.
    
4. **Interference and Signal Attenuation:** Wireless communication in ad hoc networks is susceptible to interference and signal attenuation, which can affect the quality and reliability of communication links.
    
5. **Security Concerns:** QoS mechanisms must be designed to ensure that they do not compromise the security of the network, such as by exposing sensitive information or allowing unauthorized access.
    

### QoS Mechanisms in Ad Hoc Networks

1. **Traffic Differentiation:** Different types of traffic are prioritized based on their QoS requirements. For example, real-time traffic like voice and video may be given higher priority than non-real-time traffic like file transfers.
    
2. **Quality-Aware Routing:** Routing protocols consider QoS metrics (e.g., delay, bandwidth, jitter) when selecting routes to ensure that they meet the requirements of the applications.
    
3. **Resource Reservation:** Nodes can reserve resources along a path for a specific flow to guarantee the required QoS. This can be achieved through protocols like RSVP (Resource Reservation Protocol).
    
4. **Adaptive Modulation and Coding:** Wireless links can adapt their modulation and coding schemes based on channel conditions to maintain a certain level of QoS.
    
5. **Cross-Layer Optimization:** QoS can be improved by optimizing interactions between different layers of the protocol stack, such as the network, transport, and application layers.
    
6. **Load Balancing:** Distributing traffic evenly across the network helps prevent congestion and ensures that QoS requirements are met for all users.
