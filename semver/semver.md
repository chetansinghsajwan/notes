# Semantic Versioning

It is a versioning scheme developed by [Tom Preston-Werner](people/tom-preston-verner) in 2011.

The idea behind semver is to provide a robust and consistent versioning scheme which is based on the source code changes.

It has two versions, [v1](/semver/v1) was released in 2011 and [v2](/semver/v2) in 2013.
