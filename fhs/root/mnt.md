# FHS `/media` dir

This directory contains subdirectories which are used as mount points for removable media such as floppy disks, cdroms and zip disks.

### Rationale

Historically there have been a number of other different places used to mount removable media such as `/cdrom`, `/mnt` or `/mnt/cdrom`. Placing the mount points for all removable media directly in the root directory would potentially result in a large number of extra directories in `/`. Although the use of subdirectories in `/mnt` as a mount point has recently been common, it conflicts with a much older tradition of using `/mnt` directly as a temporary mount point.

### 3.11.2.Â Specific Options

The following directories, or symbolic links to directories, must be in `/media`, if the corresponding subsystem is installed:

|Directory|Description|
|:--|:--|
|`floppy`|Floppy drive (optional)|
|`cdrom`|CD-ROM drive (optional)|
|`cdrecorder`|CD writer (optional)|
|`zip`|Zip drive (optional)|

On systems where more than one device exists for mounting a certain type of media, mount directories can be created by appending a digit to the name of those available above starting with '0', but the unqualified name must also exist.
