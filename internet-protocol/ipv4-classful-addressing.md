# IPV4 Classful Addressing

A **classful network** is an obsolete [network addressing](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/articles/Network_address "Network address") architecture used in the [Internet](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/articles/Internet "Internet") from 1981 until the introduction of [Classless Inter-Domain Routing](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/articles/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing "Classless Inter-Domain Routing") (CIDR) in 1993.

The method divides the [IP address](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/articles/IP_address "IP address") space for [Internet Protocol version 4](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/articles/Internet_Protocol_version_4 "Internet Protocol version 4") (IPv4) into five address classes based on the leading four address bits.

## History

In the original address definition, the most significant eight bits of the 32-bit IPv4 address was the _network number_ field which specified the particular network a host was attached to. The remaining 24 bits specified the local address, also called _rest field_ (the rest of the address), which uniquely identified a host connected to that network.[[1]](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/articles/Classful_network#cite_note-1) This format was sufficient at a time when only a few large networks existed, such as the [ARPANET](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/articles/ARPANET "ARPANET") (network number 10), and before the wide proliferation of [local area networks](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/articles/Local_area_network "Local area network") (LANs). As a consequence of this architecture, the address space supported only a low number (254) of independent networks.

Before the introduction of address classes, the only address blocks available were these large blocks which later became known as Class A networks.[[2]](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/articles/Classful_network#cite_note-2) As a result, some organizations involved in the early development of the Internet received very large address space allocations (16,777,216 IP addresses each).
