# IPV4 Classful Addressing

A **classful network** is an obsolete [network addressing](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/articles/Network_address "Network address") architecture used in the [Internet](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/articles/Internet "Internet") from 1981 until the introduction of [Classless Inter-Domain Routing](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/articles/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing "Classless Inter-Domain Routing") (CIDR) in 1993.

The method divides the [IP address](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/articles/IP_address "IP address") space for [Internet Protocol version 4](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/articles/Internet_Protocol_version_4 "Internet Protocol version 4") (IPv4) into five address classes based on the leading four address bits.
