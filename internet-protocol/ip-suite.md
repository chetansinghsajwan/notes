# Internet Protocol Suite

Commonly known as TCP/IP.

It is a framework for organizing the set of [communication-protocols](computer-science/networking/communication-protocols) used in the [internet](internet.md).

The foundational protocols in the suite are the [Transmission Control Protocol](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Transmission_Control_Protocol "Transmission Control Protocol") (TCP), the [User Datagram Protocol](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/User_Datagram_Protocol "User Datagram Protocol") (UDP), and the [Internet Protocol](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Internet_Protocol "Internet Protocol") (IP).

Early versions of this networking model were known as the **Department of Defense** (**DoD**) **model** because the research and development were funded by the [United States Department of Defense](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/United_States_Department_of_Defense "United States Department of Defense") through [DARPA](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/DARPA "DARPA").

The Internet protocol suite provides [end-to-end data communication](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/End-to-end_principle "End-to-end principle") specifying how data should be packetized, addressed, transmitted, [routed](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Routing "Routing"), and received.

This functionality is organized into four [abstraction layers](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Abstraction_layer "Abstraction layer"), which classify all related protocols according to each protocol's scope of networking.[](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Internet_protocol_suite#cite_note-rfc1122-1)[](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Internet_protocol_suite#cite_note-R9Fra-2)

An implementation of the layers for a particular application forms a [protocol stack](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Protocol_stack "Protocol stack").

The [technical standards](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Technical_standard "Technical standard") underlying the Internet protocol suite and its constituent protocols are maintained by the [Internet Engineering Task Force](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Internet_Engineering_Task_Force) (IETF).
