# Classless Addressing

Introduced by [IETF](ietf/ietf) in 1993 to replace classful addressing. Its goal was to slow the growth of [routing tables](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/articles/Routing_table "Routing table") on [routers](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/articles/Router_\(computing\) "Router (computing)") across the Internet, and to help slow the rapid exhaustion of IPv4 addresses.
