# IPV4

An IPv4 address is a series of four eight-bit binary numbers separated by a decimal point. Although you may use any numbering system to represent a unique 32-bit number, most commonly you see IP addresses expressed in dot-decimal notation.

### Early IPv4 routing

Initially, the standard defined the first octet as a network identifier, but with only 256 unique values, the number of available networks quickly ran out. Several different changes made over the years have allowed for the extension of IPv4’s life. First came the division of the available addresses into five classes: A, B, C, D, and E.

The class system defined which class a network belongs in based on its first octet.

- Class A network’s first octet begins with 0. The first octet identifies the network. Class A supports 127 networks, each with 16 million hosts.

- Class B network’s first octet begins with 10. The first and second octets identify the network. Class B upports 16,000 networks, each with 65,000 hosts.

- Class C network’s first octet begins with 110. The first three octets identify the network. Class C supports 2 million networks, each with 254 hosts.

- Class D network’s first octet begins with 1110. Class D is reserved for multicast groups.

- Class E network’s first octet begins with 1111. Class E is reserved for future use.
