# CSS

**Cascading Style Sheets** (**CSS**) is a [stylesheet](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/StyleSheet) language used to describe the presentation of a document written in [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) or [XML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/XML/XML_introduction) (including XML dialects such as [SVG](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG), [MathML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/MathML) or [XHTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/XHTML)).

It is standardized by [W3C specifications](https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/#specs).

Previously, the development of various parts of CSS specification was done synchronously, which allowed the versioning of the latest recommendations. You might have heard about CSS1, CSS2.1, or even CSS3. There will never be a CSS3 or a CSS4; rather, everything is now just "CSS" with individual CSS modules having version numbers.
