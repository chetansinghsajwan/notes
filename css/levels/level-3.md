# CSS Level 3

[CSS Level 3](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-2023/#css-level-3) builds on CSS Level 2 module by module, using the CSS2.1 specification as its core. Each module adds functionality and/or replaces part of the CSS2.1 specification. The CSS Working Group intends that the new CSS modules will not contradict the CSS2.1 specification: only that they will add functionality and refine definitions. As each module is completed, it will be plugged in to the existing system of CSS2.1 plus previously-completed modules.

From this level on modules are levelled independently: for example Selectors Level 4 may well be completed before CSS Line Module Level 3. Modules with no [CSS Level 2](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-2023/#css-level-2) equivalent start at Level 1; modules that update features that existed in CSS Level 2 start at Level 3.
