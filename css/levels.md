# CSS Levels

Cascading Style Sheets does not have versions in the traditional sense; instead it hasÂ levels[](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-2023/#levels). Each level of CSS builds on the previous, refining definitions and adding features. The feature set of each higher level is a superset of any lower level, and the behavior allowed for a given feature in a higher level is a subset of that allowed in the lower levels. A user agent conforming to a higher level of CSS is thus also conformant to all lower levels.
