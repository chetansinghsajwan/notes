# CSS Layout

The elements that appear one below the other are described as **block** elements, in contrast to **inline** elements, which appear beside one another like the individual words in a paragraph.

---
**Note**

The direction in which block element contents are laid out is described as the Block Direction. The Block Direction runs vertically in a language such as English, which has a horizontal writing mode. It would run horizontally in any language with a Vertical Writing Mode, such as Japanese. The corresponding Inline Direction is the direction in which inline contents (such as a sentence) would run.
