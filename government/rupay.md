## Background

In 2009, [RBI](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/articles/Reserve_Bank_of_India "Reserve Bank of India") asked the [Indian Banks' Association](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/articles/Indian_Banks'_Association "Indian Banks' Association") to create a non-profit payment company which will design an indigenous payment card. The card was tentatively referred as India Pay. After years of planning, [NPCI](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/articles/National_Payments_Corporation_of_India "National Payments Corporation of India") was entrusted with the implementation[](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/articles/RuPay#cite_note-9) and finalised the name of the proposed card as RuPay, a [portmanteau](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/articles/Portmanteau "Portmanteau") of the words [_ru_pee](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/articles/Indian_rupee "Indian rupee") and _pay_ment to avoid naming conflicts with other financial institutions using the same name.

RBI, in its vision paper 2009â€“2012 on payment systems in India said that the need for such a system arises from the absence of a domestic price setter, causing Indian banks to bear the high cost for affiliation and the connection with international card associations schemes like Visa and Mastercard

NPCI launched an international subsidiary called [NPCI International Payments Limited](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/articles/NPCI_International_Payments_Limited "NPCI International Payments Limited") (NIPL) on 19 August 2020 to increase the globalisation and availability of RuPay in foreign markets.
