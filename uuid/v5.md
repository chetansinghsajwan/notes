# UUID V5

If you want a unique ID thatâ€™s not random, UUID v5 could be the right choice.

Unlike v1 or v4, UUID v5 is generated by providing two pieces of input information:

1. **Input string:** Any string that can change in your application.

2. **Namespace:** A fixed UUID used in combination with the input string to differentiate between UUIDs generated in different applications, and to prevent [rainbow table hacks](https://www.hackingloops.com/what-are-rainbow-tables/)

These two pieces of information are converted to a UUID using the SHA1 hashing algorithm.
