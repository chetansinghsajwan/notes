# UUID

UUID stands for Universally unique identifier. Also known as GUID in Microsoft systems. It is a 128 bit of data that is used to uniquely identify objects in computer systems.

It is standardized by [IETF](/ietf/ietf). Well not actually standardized, as of 2024 December, it is a proposed standard tracked in RFC 

UUIDs are standardized by the Open Software Foundation (OSF) as part of the [Distributed Computing Environment](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/articles/Distributed_Computing_Environment "Distributed Computing Environment").

Types of UUIDs:

- [v1](/uuid/v1)
- [v2](/uuid/v2)
- [v3](/uuid/v3)
- [v4](/uuid/v4)
- [v5](/uuid/v5)

#### Nil UUID

The "nil" UUID is the UUID `00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000`; that is, all bits set to zero.[](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/articles/Universally_unique_identifier#cite_note-RFC_9562-1)

#### Max UUID

The "max" UUID, sometimes also called the "omni" UUID, is the UUID `FFFFFFFF-FFFF-FFFF-FFFF-FFFFFFFFFFFF`; that is, all bits set to one.[](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/articles/Universally_unique_identifier#cite_note-RFC_9562-1)
