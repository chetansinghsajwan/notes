# UUID

UUID stands for Universally unique identifier. Also known as GUID in Microsoft systems. It is a 128 bit of data that is used to uniquely identify objects in computer systems.

It is standardized by [IETF](/ietf/ietf). Well not actually standardized, as of 2024 December, it is a proposed standard tracked in [RFC 4122](/ietf/rfc/4122) which was proposed in 2005. Then came a new rfc [RFC 9562] proposed in 2024 May which obsoletes RFC 4122. This new RFC is now responsible to standardize UUID.

There are 8 versions of UUID:
- [v1](/uuid/v1)
- [v2](/uuid/v2)
- [v3](/uuid/v3)
- [v4](/uuid/v4)
- [v5](/uuid/v5)
- [v6](/uuid/v6)
- [v7](/uuid/v7)
- [v8](/uuid/v8)

#### Nil UUID

The "nil" UUID is the UUID `00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000`; that is, all bits set to zero.[](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/articles/Universally_unique_identifier#cite_note-RFC_9562-1)

#### Max UUID

The "max" UUID, sometimes also called the "omni" UUID, is the UUID `FFFFFFFF-FFFF-FFFF-FFFF-FFFFFFFFFFFF`; that is, all bits set to one.[](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/articles/Universally_unique_identifier#cite_note-RFC_9562-1)
