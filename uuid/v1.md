# UUID V1

UUID v1 is generated by using a combination the host computers MAC address and the current date and time.

In addition to this, it also introduces another random component just to be sure of its uniqueness.

This means you are guaranteed to get a completely unique ID, unless you generate it from the _same_ computer, and at the exact _same_ time.

In that case, the chance of collision changes from impossible to very very small because of the random bits.

This guaranteed uniqueness comes at the cost of anonymity. Because UUID v1 takes the time and your MAC address into consideration, this also means that someone could potentially identify the time and place(i.e.  
computer) of creation.
