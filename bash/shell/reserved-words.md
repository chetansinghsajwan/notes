# Reserved Words

Reserved words are words that have special meaning to the shell. They are used to begin and end the shellâ€™s compound commands.

The following words are recognized as reserved when unquoted and the first word of a command: `if`, `then`, `elif`, `else`, `fi`, `time`, `for`, `in`, `untiil`, `while`, `do`, `done`, `case`, `esac`, `coproc`, `select`, `function`, `{`, `}`, `[[`, `]]`, `!`.

`in` is recognized as a reserved word if it is the third word of a `case` or `select` command. `in` and `do` are recognized as reserved words if they are the third word in a `for` command.
